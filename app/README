DMthis README

DMthis is a primarily a Twitter bot that has two functions:
 1) Listens to @<name> statuses for instructions on what accounts to "follow"
 2) Listens to stream containing status for "followed" users. Upon receipt, 
    truncates these statuses and sends them to "following" users via DM.

Requirements
 * Ruby >= 1.9.3
 * Libraries: See Gemfile

N.B.
This is a slow work in progress for me to try my hand at Ruby. I'd like to make 
this more object-oriented and tested at some point, practical usage depending.
